# Mathematics-Open-Degree

I really like maths. Below, I layout how one could attempt to teach themselves mathematics required by undergraduate math students, feeling as though there is no clear guide anywhere. It is mainly for myself, as I journey through self-learning the mathematics required of anyone who aspires to be a mathematician. A lot of the below is guided by content from the 'The Math Sorcerer' on youtube, see him for great videos on math. It does not serve, really, as a guide to learn mathematics from beginning to end. And anyway, if your trigonometry is shakey, but you really want to see how to learn some calculus, what's stopping you?
