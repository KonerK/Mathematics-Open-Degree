# Mathematics-Open-Degree

The below serves as a rough guide to self-learning mathematics. A lot of the below is guided by the content from 'The Math Sorcer' on youtube, so go see him for great math content. Mainly, I am using the below to document my journey through self studying maths, as well as provide insight for others who may similarly want to self-study maths. If you're reading this and aspire to be a mathematician, good luck! I'm rooting for you. 

# Act I - The Fundamentals

### 1) Fundamental Algebra 

There are lots of great 'basic' algebra books out there, ones of my favourite includes Robet Blitzer's 'College Algebra'.

| Books         | Content to Learn |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 'College Algebra', Robert Blitzer  | Fundamental Concepts of Algebra - Equations and Inequalities - Function Basics & Graphs - Polynomial & Rational Functions - Exponential and Logarithmic Functions - Partial Fractions - Matrices and Determines - Conic Sections|

### 2) Fundamental Trigonometry 

Not a lot of books are dedicated solely to trigonometry, which is a shame. Either of the books below both give a good introduction to trigonometry, but I prefer James Stewart's book. 

| Books         | Content to Learn |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 'PreCalculus', Robert Blitzer  | Trigonometric Functions - Analytic Trigonometry - Additional Topics in Trigonometry |
| 'PreCalculus', James Stewart  | Trigonometric Functions: Unit Circle Approach - Trigonometric Functions: Right Triangle Approach - Analytic Trigonometry  |

### 3) Fundamental Objects in Mathematics (Sets, Functions, Proof)

Discrete Mathematics, to me, feels like an important transition to mathematics at undergraduate level, where the focus lies much less in memorising, and much more in mathematical reasoning and understanding. Here, we essentially want to learn the language of maths. Thorough knowledge of sets, functions, relations will serve you very well. I have highlighted some great books below.

| Books         | Content to Learn |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 'Discrete Mathematics & Its Applications', Kenneth Rosen | The Foundations: Logic & Proofs - Sets, Functions, Matrices - Counting - Introduction to Discrete Probability |
| 'Introducing Mathematics: Algebra & Analysis', Geoff Smith | Sets, Functions and Relations - Proof |
| 'Discrete Mathematical Structures', Bernard Kolman| Fundamentals - Logic - Counting - Relations & Digraphs |
| 'How to Prove It', Daniel Velleman | Proof - Mathematical Induction - Number Theory - Infinite Sets |
