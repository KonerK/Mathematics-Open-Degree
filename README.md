# Mathematics-Open-Degree

My main interests currently lie in mathematics. At university, my favourite modules were always the mathematics ones (foundations of computation, graph theory, optimisation, discrete mathematics etc), but this left me annoyed that I didn't have the same breadth of knowledge as the mathematics students. I'm a massive advocate for self-learning, and so this repository marks my journey in trying to give myself the knowledge of a mathematics student. Having a good background in mathematics, the following content is mainly informed by the order I think it best to learn different topics in maths (though one of the great parts of self-study is that you can really start anywhere you want! If you want to start with real analysis, why not?)

So, the below can serve as guide to getting started with self-teaching mathematics, but mainly is just for me to keep track of my own progress. See The Math Sorcerer on youtube for some great inspiration on self-teaching maths.
